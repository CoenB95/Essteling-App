    <string name="faq_a_launchGame">
        You can launch games from the home-menu. Once your device is connected to a specific
        attraction, it will appear under "nearby attractions". If you tap the name of the attraction
        or the big purple "play" button next to it, the game will launch. This app connects to
        attractions with Bluetooth, so make sure Bluetooth is enabled.

        How does the game of Anaconda work?

    <string name="faq_a_controlsAnaconda">
        In Anaconda you play as a snake with gold fever. The aim of the game is eating as many
        gold coins as possible. The snake will get longer every time you eat a coin.
        If you want the snake to go in a certain direction, simply swipe in that direction.
        The snake is also able to leave the playing field. It will return from the opposite side.
